					It was late; Adolff was working on an idea when he got a call from Leena. “Hey, you free?” asked Leena, “No Leens, I am priceless,” he replied. 
					“Please be serious, I need a favor, there is this staff of mine, she is too good at her work but she wants to quit. I am unable to understand the reason. Can we meet her and try and find out her concerns?” suggested the worried Leena. 
					“That’s a good idea, we should try to help her if there is anything,” Adolff replied. “Great, let’s catch up at seven, will text you the details. Thanks, Adolff.” 
					“What friends are for, Leens!” 
					It was seven in the evening, when Leena came with a lady to meet Adolff at a restaurant as mentioned by her. 
					“Hey, so sorry Adolff, I got late,” said Leena as they got to the seats where Adolff was already seated, “Adolff, she is Bhavya,” Leena added. 
					“Hi Bhavya, how are you? Leena is all praises for you which is not a normal thing,” Adolff winked, trying to make the environment light. 
					“Nothing like that, I’m good, and how about you?” she laughed, and immediately her smile faded. 
					“I’m good too. Bhavya, I am told that you are planning to quit,” Adolff said, coming to the point straight away. 
					“I have already submitted the papers,” she said looking away. 
					“Bhavya, we are here to help, we are trying to understand what is bothering you. You are the fastest growing person in our company, we are offering you good salary and all the perks have been offered to you, then why do you want to leave?” Leena added.

					“Leena, it’s not professional but a personal reason and its very personal,” she said and her voice went heavy as she took a sip of water from the glass kept at front. 
					“But these things do not matter to you as much as he does, am I right Bhavya?” asked Adolff casually. She was aghast, as she asked, “How do you know him?” 
					“I don’t know him, its too evident for anyone to understand that you are walking out of a personal reason and the reason I guess is that either you are heart broken or you are hell bent to destroy yourself so that he may just realize and come to you.” 
					“That’s the reason, I want to leave Mumbai and go somewhere else.” Her tone was full of rage and Adolff said, “Go on, we are all ears, lady.” 
					“There is this man, I am madly in love and he doesn’t care for me and I think its best for me to leave the city and go somewhere to start a fresh.” 
					“Hey, no one is worth spoiling your career and breaking you and your ambitions.” Leena interrupted, Bhavya had tears in her eyes and Adolff was quick to change the environment, as he said, “Let’s order something,” just to give her a break so that she could collect herself. Once the order was placed, Adolff started, “Look Bhavya, your problem is not this person, your problem is that you are trying to run away from a situation. I am speaking to you only as a friend and not as company representative. What’s the exact problem?” 
					“He only speaks nicely when he wants to and then there are weeks and he won’t even call up and suddenly he come and says he loves me and cares a lot and then again. I am left yearning for his affection for days, weeks and at times months. If some one calls me, he will get upset, he gets very possessive and he will only want to hear what he wants to and, I like a dumb have done it all for him but he just doesn’t care.” 
					“Look dear, he is not a good man. A man in love with you shall get insecure only when he knows someone else can treat you better than him. When he does not bother for you, why the hell are you throwing away your career? I fail to see the logic behind this.” Said Leena. 
					</p><p class=" sample-watermark"> &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp
					Adolff was smiling and he said, “Leens, you won’t find logic here, it’s a matter of heart,” he paused looking for a reaction, and he added further, “He loves you a lot, Bhavya.” 
					“Do you think so?” asked Bhavya. 
					“I am pretty sure about it. You know when does a man get insecure, it happens when he longs to be the sole reason for your happiness and when he feels a threat that you may take a liking for someone else. It’s not possessiveness; it’s a feeling to be right there for all what makes you happy. Sometimes he will express and then he won’t, this is what Love is, it’s never certain, it’s forever delicate and is need of acceptance and nurturing for it to grow. What you have to risk is, that your Love needs will be received and reciprocated, with any risk there is always the possibility you might have to face it failing and with that failure you do not give into it, and again dare to strive for love to be whole. You need to talk it out with him, don’t run away, he is the right person for you, he loves and cares for you as much as he can. Look Bhavya, we all are driven to take more and give less. In love when this drive to give is broken and deeply felt love is denied, it is the disappointment of love not being realized. You are doing the same mistake. It’s too simple, do not complicate it, we all needa shoulder and a support in life, you have it, don’t blow it away just because he is not conducting himself in the manner you want him to. You should sort it out, love is about just being there and making it happen.” 
					“Adolff, you are speaking as if he has sent you as his representative,” Leena giggled, and Bhavya smiled for the first time. 
					With dinner being served, Bhavya asked, “You think, I should talk to him?” and he said, “No, go and fight with him, break his couple of bones and then say get lost,” as he laughed.

					“Just go and stop fighting this futile battle of trying to convince yourself that you don’t love him, or you don’t need him, you are running away just by saying I am done and now I will be happy without him. You cannot be once in love always in love.” Adolff added sensing her smile fading away. 
					“Fine, I will speak with him for one last time,” she added. 
					“No dear, nurture it, let it blossom. You know, for red roses to blossom in winters, the plant has to be taken care off for the entire year. When the roses stem up, then you feel it was worth the wait and the beauty is here to be seen, and fragrance to be felt. Nurture it, when it will blossom, you will say, ‘Hey, we made it,’ and then you can love again and be loved again, in true sense of the word Bhavya. It’s just that you need to add up all the small drops, which quench your thirst for love. Then every step you take will make you feel that you are meant to be together. Don’t let it die, give it a lifeline. Tell him, I am waiting for you.” 
					“Your words made me wonder, thank you,” Bhavya said, looking into her thoughts, “Leena, can you ignore my resignation papers, please?” added Bhavya and they all laughed. Bhavya was so impressed by Adolff that she was forced to ask, “What do you think about Love? Do you have someone in your life?” 
					“Shall I tell her, Leena?” Adolff winked, “Please, even I would love to hear it.” Leena grinned. 
					“I don’t want a person to laugh, I need a person to cry and see my pain in her eyes and a silence which just comforts me, a touch of her which heals me. A smile that makes me forget things to be done. I want a person who will be willing to see all the scars on my soul and say they are beautiful, who will see a rainbow in my tears and say this is my sky, filled with radiant colors of hope.” Adolff said, going in his dream world.

					“That’s going to be impossible, you are talking about an ideal love.” 
					“I am talking about pure love, an unconditional love where you are giving and sacrificing yet feeling happy about it. I agree, it’s difficult to find this kind of love but then, that’s my choice and when I will find such a person, then she will be mine for all the days to come. For me she would be and she should be my inspiration to breathe, my hope to live, and my love to feel.” Replied Adolff. 
					“Wow, so amazing,” expressed Bhavya. “Why do we have so many heart breaks?” asked Leena “Hearts will break because they are filled with emotions and these emotions are seldom expressed and when they are expressed at times it’s too early or it’s too late. In both cases they all go in vain and leave the heart yearning for that soul which is for you, where you can just lie bare without the fear of rejection and thrill of acceptance. Its just your soul to another and your feelings for other heart”. 
					“Good heavens, Adolff,” sighed Leena, looking away, “I hope you find your someone soon and as far as I am concerned, I am too busy to get into any relationship, which is demanding,” she added. “You know Leens, when it will happen then you will not find it demanding, on the contrary you will find it desirable.” 
					“Adolff, Love always gives you a transient pleasure and an everlasting pain.” 
					“Leens, for me love has to be a warm feeling which once is decided, then I am into it, the shades may change but the portrait will remain.” 
					“It has to be a two way street, right Adolff?” Leena asked 
					“If at all its true and ideal love then the absence of the other person should not matter, because that person is a part of you in totality and in absolute sense of a sweet surrender. True love will make you better not bitter, it will make you strong not weak, it will give u will to do things just because some one some where whom you truly love will feel good about it.”

					“I wish, you find her soon. As of now this is not happening Adolff, this is too idealistic you are talking about. In one phrase, its, ‘Too good to be true’. Love is wanted by every one and very few actually get it and those who get it, they realize it when they loose it. This kind of intense love of yours will give you intense pain and you will be shattered, broken down and dusted, so my advise to you will be, be careful.” 
					“That will be for the first time and I have only one life, might experience this as well, who knows you may make a movie on my love story,” winked Adolff as they all laughed, “No Adolff, you are very nice and different person, what I like the most about you is that you are not fake, you are what you are and that’s a very difficult thing in today’s world,” complimented Leena. 
					"I wish, you find your soul mate soon," said Bhavya.
