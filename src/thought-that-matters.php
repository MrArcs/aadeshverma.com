					<p>Dear Reader<br />
					Greetings for the day !!!</p>
					<p>I must thank you for reading A&E. Do communicate to me on your thoughts as they matter a lot to me personally and professionally.</p>
					<p>Words, Words and Words, When shaped in a manner that they traverse through the heart of a reader is a task, which calls for more than an effort to accomplish it.Every minute spend during this journey has been more than worth, As it has reached the place where it should be, right into your hands, placed on your lap top or placed on your book shelf . This gives a profound satisfaction to me.</p>
					<p>When I started to write ,I never realized that people who touch you are always around they never leave you. Some relations and some memories are in your life forever, sometimes with you, and at times far away from you.</p>
					<p>Thanks will be a small word to express my feelings but then at times language has its limitations. May all your dreams come true today and everyday !!!</p>
					<p>With Warm Personal Regards<br />
